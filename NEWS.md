**This version of `'BayLum'` requires R\>=4.1.x!**

## New functions

-   `write_BayLumFiles()`: @IMHarly contributed an excellent new
    function that creates all folders and files needed for `'BayLum'`,
    making it a lot easier and less error-prone to work with `'BayLum'`.

## Bugfixes and changes

-   The function now supports parallel processing using the package
    `'rungjags'` (thanks to @IMHarly)

### `Age_OSLC14()`

    were actually in the model; fixed. (thanks to @IMHarly, \#21)
-   The function now supports parallel processing using the package
    `'rungjags'` (thanks to @IMHarly)
