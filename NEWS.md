# BayLum 0.3.1.9000-4 (2022-11-03)

**This version of `'BayLum'` requires R\>=4.1.x!**

## Bugfixes and changes

- `AgeS_Computation()` crashed reproducibly if the THETA matrix (as one
  possibility) was provided indeed as a file name instead of a `matrix`
  object; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari for reporting)

- `create_ThetaMatrix()` the function did not throw an error in all
  cases where `sigma_s` was obviously wrong; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari
  for reporting)
