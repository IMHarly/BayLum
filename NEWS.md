# BayLum 0.3.1.9000-12 (2023-01-28)

**This version of `'BayLum'` requires R\>=4.1.x!**

## Bugfixes and changes

- `AgeS_Computation()` crashed reproducibly if the THETA matrix (as one
  possibility) was provided indeed as a file name instead of a `matrix`
  object; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari for reporting)

- `create_ThetaMatrix()` the function did not throw an error in all
  cases where `sigma_s` was obviously wrong; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari
  for reporting)

- `Generate_DataFile_MG()` the function now tests checks the number of
  specified BIN-files matches the actual number of BIN-files in the the
  folders. If not, a warnings is prompted because if the number is wrong
  this can lead to very hard to track down problems.

- `plot_Ages()` gained a couple of new arguments. `plot_mode` allows to
  switch between the standard plot output `"ages"` (default) and the new
  option `"density"`. The latter showing probability density estimates.
  Further arguments specific to the `plot_mode = "density"` are
  `d_scale` to scale the density plots in height, `show_ages` to show
  the Bayes estimator. More general, `legend.cex` to scale the legend
  fonts and this work for both plot modes
