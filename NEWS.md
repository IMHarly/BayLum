# BayLum 0.3.1.9000-12 (2023-01-31)

**This version of `'BayLum'` requires R\>=4.1.x!**

## Bugfixes and changes

- `AgeS_Computation()` crashed reproducibly, if the THETA matrix (as one
  possibility) was provided indeed as a file name instead of a `matrix`
  object; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari for reporting)

- `create_ThetaMatrix()` the function did not throw an error in all
  cases where `sigma_s` was obviously wrong; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari
  for reporting)

- `Generate_DataFile_MG()` the function now checks that the number of
  specified BIN/BINX-files matches the actual number of BIN/BINX-files
  present in the folders. If not, a warning is prompted. This prevents
  hard-to-track-down error messages and odd modelling results that
  erroneously encourage searching for problems with JAGS or the BayLum
  models.

- `plot_Ages()` gained a couple of new arguments. First, `plot_mode`
  allows to switch between the standard plot output `"ages"` (the
  default) and the new option `"density"`. The latter draws probability
  density curves instead of lines. Further arguments specific to the
  `plot_mode = "density"` are `d_scale` to scale the density plots in
  height and `show_ages` to show the Bayes estimator. More generally,
  `legend.cex` was added to enable a convenient scaling of the legend
  fonts; this works for both plot modes.
