# BayLum `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This version of `'BayLum'` requires R>=4.1.x!**

## New functions
* `write_BayLumFiles()`: @IMHarly contributed an excellent new function that creates
all folders and files needed for `'BayLum'`, making it easier and less error-prone to 
work with `'BayLum'`

## Bugfixes and changes

### `AgeS_Computation()`
* The function now supports parallel processing using the package `'rungjags'` (thanks to @IMHarly)

### `Age_OSLC14()`
* Regression error, the function tried to observe more variables than were actually in the model; fixed.
(thanks to  @IMHarly, #21)
* The function now supports parallel processing using the package `'rungjags'` (thanks to @IMHarly)

## Internals
* A few fixes regarding string comparisons in `if()` conditions.
