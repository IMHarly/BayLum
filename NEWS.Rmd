# BayLum `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This version of `'BayLum'` requires R>=4.1.x!**

## Bugfixes and changes

* `AgeS_Computation()` crashed reproducibly if the THETA matrix (as one possibility) was provided
indeed as a file name instead of a `matrix` object; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari for reporting)
